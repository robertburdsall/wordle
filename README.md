<h1> Wordle in JavaFX</h1>

<h3> This program is nothing too special but showcases one of my first implementations of JavaFX. This program was created through one of my classes at school and I thought it was cool enough to put on my github!</h3>

<h3> For the UI I was able to use Scenebuilder (though that was minimal as most of the work was done in the controller / logic. Rest of the work was done via the JavaFX package</h3>
